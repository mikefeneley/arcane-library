<p><strong>Modern Art</strong></p>

<p>Modern art is a confidence game. Everybody has an agenda and tries to push a narrative. The motive is usually financial, but not always so.</p>

<p>My favourite art is Renaissance statues, usually portraying Greek men involved in an epic struggle, either against each other or some mythological monster.</p>

<p>I like these statutes because I like what the artist is trying to do, glorify man and his accomplishments by portraying accomplishment and the ideal form. Even if the man in the statute is losing , virtue is still being glorified. Heroism, courage, and ambition are celebrated even in defeat.</p>

<p>Most of the pre-modern art tends to try and do this or something similar. </p>

<p>Many portraits in a national gallery portray a member of the church or nobility. The purpose is clear, glorify the nobility or church member.</p>

<p>Another common theme is to portray religious scenery. Again the purpose is clear, to glorify God and the church.</p>

<p>The purpose of this art is clear. Even if you disagree with the message of the art, you can understand why it exists.</p>

<p>Modern art, specifically abstract expressionism, differs in that the selling point of the art is it’s lack of a message, or at least it’s lack of clarity.</p>

<p>I think if you can’t understand the message of the art, then the art is worthless to you as the consumer of the art.</p>

<p>I say worthless to you as a consumer because the art does fills a certain function. In the case of abstract art, the purpose was twofold, to make the artists and art brokers wealthy, and to serve as a cultural counterpoint to the Soviet art scene during the cold war.</p>

<p>In theory I have no problem with either of these goals, but why should you as the art consumer buy into the narrative that abstract art is meaningful and has intrinsic value? It certainly is not worth the millions that Jackson Pollack paintings cost.</p>

<p>Abstract art is very interesting that it’s purpose was to serve as a counterbalance to Russian culture during the cold war. But the art itself is meaningless and boring. To pretend otherwise without a dose of doublethink of the ulterior motive is foolish.</p>

<p>In fact, I think much of modern art is more than just worthless, it has negative effect on society. There is too much cynicism and negativity in modern society as is. Art, like everything else, can be used for good or ill. It is much better to create art that pushes people to better themselves by portraying positive virtue rather than encourages unproductive thoughts and behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract art supports a thought I have that at some point, all civilizations reach the point where they have enough resources that they need to start displaying their wealth by employing people to do something meaningless, for example creating endless rows of cat figurines like you see in the Egyptian wing of the Louvre.</p>
