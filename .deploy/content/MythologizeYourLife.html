<p><strong>Mythologize Your Life</strong>
<hr></p>

<p><strong>Power of Belief</strong></p>

<p>Belief is more important than fact. </p>

<p>Narratives dictate behavior. People act in accordance with the current narrative regardless of objective truth.</p>

<p>A man who believes himself to be weak will act weak. A man who believes himself to be strong, will act confident.</p>

<p>The common self help solution is to fake it until you make it. Act as if you are the person you want to be and eventually you will become that person.</p>

<p>This is good advice, but it should be taken one step further. Create a mythology for your life. A divine purpose which pushes you towards greatness.</p>

<p>Some of the most fanatical people on earth today are religious terrorists. Belief in a divine mission provides the motivation and spiritual energy to continue in the face of extreme opposition. </p>

<p>The means and ends of religious terrorists are deplorable, but there is a technique to be learned from them that can enrich your life.</p>

<p>First pick a purpose for your life. Start a business, raise a family, bring world peace, whatever. Different things are important to different people. No one knows what is in your heart, only you can determine what your life’s purpose should be.</p>

<p>Next, create a story that mythologizes the journey to achieve this goal. Develop a narrative that provides the motivation and courage to continue along the right path when times are tough.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that the spiritual energy given from mythology and divine purpose is a stronger motivating force than purely secular goals. </p>

<p>Everyone goes through periods of depression and apathy in their lives. This is especially true in western nations where the values and goals imparted by society like, money, fame, and status, are ultimately empty and unfulfilling.</p>

<p>It can be difficult to take right action in pursuit of our goals when the ends are ultimately unfulfilling. But by taking these goals and turning them into epic quests, it becomes trivial to pursue them, at least from an emotional standpoint.</p>

<p>This applies even for “rationalists” and atheists/agnostics. I don’t believe in gods in a real sense. I only believe when it is practical for me to believe, usually when I have issues with motivation or discipline.</p>

<p>An example of how I see this working:</p>

<p>Suppose you have a runic tattoo of Týr, the Norse god of war. You are a rationalist and usually don't believe in Norse gods. But when you are at the gym, you exercise doublethink and block the rationalist part of your mind in favor of the emotional part. In that moment, you truly believe that having the rune tattooed on your body imbues you with greater strength. You use this conviction and mythology to focus your mind and help you lift more weight than you would have been able to otherwise. Then, when you return to the everyday you lose the mindset that helped you lift more weight, but you keep the strength and muscle gains that resulted from it.</p>

<p><strong>Create Your Own Religion</strong></p>

<p>The chosen goals are completely subjective. There are common themes in the major religions, but if you don’t like the current offerings, create your own religion based on your personal values.</p>

<p>There are plenty of examples that can be seen from mainstream religions. If one decides to dedicate their lives to charity and helping others, they can be inspired by the words of Jesus Christ.</p>
