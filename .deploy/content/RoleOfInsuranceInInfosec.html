<p>In the future, information security and perhaps IT in general will not be managed by tech companies, but by insurance firms.</p>

<p>The problem with information security in it’s current form is that there is one of incentives. </p>

<p>Companies seek to maximize profit. Data breach and other information security risks represent a threat to profit, but one cannot determine the risk without spending money. To the layperson, if the system is not currently compromised, then investing money to investigate current infosec infrastructure and analyze risks seems like an unnecessary expenditure.</p>

<p>The result is that many companies do not use best security practices and put the business at serious risk of financial lost in the event of an attack as well as the user's data.</p>

<p>A new system which incentivizes security needs to be put in place. I think one practical solution to this would be to have mandatory cybersecurity insurance.</p>

<p>The insurance company is responsible for insuring the company in the case of a data loss. To calculate the premium, the insurance company needs to be able to audit a company's security plan and servers. If the company does not comply with best practices and have a strong security posture, then they are charged a higher premium. To keep this premiums down, the companies then start investing in cybersecurity solutions.</p>

<p>It may go further than this and the company completely outsources their cybersecurity. The cybersecurity provider is then liable for ensuring the company is not compromised. It’s sole incentive at this point is to prevent losses and bring down the cost of security. </p>
