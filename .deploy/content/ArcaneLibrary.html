<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
<hr></p>

<p>This is my personal website. I am a software engineer. My primary domain interests are systems engineering, information security, and artificial intelligence. I am trying to improve my writing, but for now it looks like it was written by Patrick Bateman. We will get better. </p>

<p><strong>About the Design</strong></p>

<p>I embrace stoicism and minimalism as productive life philosophies. I enjoy retro computer technologies and the cyberpunk literary genre. The design of this website tries to express this.</p>

<p>Websites evolved to the current design style because they proved to be the most effective at selling user's ads. They are easy to read, but the primary goal of the majority of websites is not to provide the user content, but to show them advertisements. Reading the content itself is secondary. The design style is chosen to require the smallest amount of effort possible otherwise the owner risks having users go and look at someone else's advertisements.</p>

<p>A simplistic, text only web design requires more effort from the user to focus and concentrate on reading. But by requiring greater focus, the website creates value for the user. With greater focus comes greater understanding and retention of the content. The font and page design choices were made so that the user has a distraction free experience. Hopefully, if you enjoy some of the content you will contact me with ideas of your own and we can explore new ideas on the path to prodigy. </p>

<p><strong>About the Site</strong></p>

<p>The about tab links to the page you are currently reading.</p>

<p>The majority of my content is hosted under essays. It contains everything I have written on a variety of subjects, but I try to focus on technology and security issues. The projects tab contains information about all the projects I have completed or am currently working on. This includes both technical and hobby related projects.</p>

<p>The resources tab contains links and reviews of all tools and technologies that I find helpful. Anything useful that is not protected by copyright will be hosted on this site. For copyright protected works, I will link to external resources. My preference is to link to resources that have been archived in order to prevent link rot and digital decay, but that is not always possible. To combat digital decay, I make local backups of all resources linked to by this website. If any of the links are broken and you would like to access them, please send me an email. You can find my contact information in the contact page. </p>

<p><strong>Config and Workflow</strong></p>

<p>Security, minimalism, resilience were the primary design constraints for this website. My first tool choice was the static site generator Cactus. Static sites have the advantage of security, speed, and simplicity over dynamic sites. What I lost by using a static site was the easy of use and flexibility that comes from using a CMS. </p>

<p>This was an easy decision to make. The speed advantage was not a huge concern as the hosted content is minimal enough to make the gains redundant. Security was a strong point in favor of static sites. Nothing of importance is being hosted here, but security is a process. It needs to be constantly practiced to develop the skill set and prevent complacency. </p>

<p>Finally, Static sites are human readable and have minimum bloat which makes the both easy to mirror and restore in case of failure. Both are key factors in making resilient websites.</p>

<p>The pages are written in markdown. When I finish writing, I use Make to convert the markdown files to html and then copy them over to the page directory. After all the files have been transferred, Cactus automatically rebuilds the website from the new html files. Once the build is complete, Cactus can deploy the website to the production server. This whole process can be automated using script.</p>

<p>My initial editing tool is google docs. I is firefox as my browser to access google docs where I would write plain markdown files. When I had make changes, I download the new file as a plain text document and transfer it to my shared virtual machine folder. From there I use a makefile to generate html files using the markdown command. The makefile then transfers all of the html files to the source directory where cactus automatically rebuilds the website. Finally, from there I can use cactus to automatically deploy the newly built website using AWS key exchange. The website is hosted in an S3 bucket provided Amazon. I use a Route 53 as my DNS service, also provided by Amazon.</p>

<p>I am looking for a more efficient way to edit. I could directly edit the files in the same folder as the makefile which would save the step of having to download and move the file over from google docs. But I find I am more efficient writing in google docs than a plain text editor because of the spell checking capabilities. A plugin for vim could possibly solve this issue. </p>

<p><strong>Content Management</strong></p>

<p>Everything here is just thinking out loud, an attempt to refine and explore ideas. I will frequently make changes and add to pages. Nothing here should be taken as my authoritative opinion on anything.</p>
