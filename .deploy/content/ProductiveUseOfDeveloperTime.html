<p><strong>Productive Use of Developer Time</strong>
<hr></p>

<p>Individuals can't build useful systems. This is not always true, but as a general rule, you cannot build a new system on your own the beats currently existing implemntation s to the same problem. It may be possible that yours is the first soluition to a problem which had not been previously been considered, but this is most likely not true. There is nothing new under the sun.</p>

<p>So if you can't expect to create anything valuable on your own, how should you spend your time? Obviously contributions to open source projects is one of the btter ways to help. Even mundane tasks such as finding small, inconsequential bugs or writing tutorials and documentation has a large impact because of the scale at which popular open source projects are used.</p>

<p>I do believe there is benefit in working on your own software projects though, but recognize the actual benefit of this practice, improving your development skill and understanding of software. The best projects in my opinion are those which are reimplementations of existing system software. For example, start writing your own microkernel, an implementation of tcp/ip, a new device driver, or any number of low level system components. It increases your knowledge of protocols and helps you learn how things work under the hood. When hardware/software abstractions break down and you need to understand how things are actually implemented, the time you spent writing your own system software will save hours in development time. Besides, in my opinion systems software is one of the most intersting domains of computer science and is fun to work on.</p>
