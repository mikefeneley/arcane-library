<p><strong>Travel/Life Notes</strong>
<hr></p>

<p><strong>Thought on Living</strong></p>

<p>I have nothing to say.</p>

<p>I certainly don’t have anything new or worthwhile to contribute. </p>

<p>I first started reading blogs and watching videos that help people improve themselves in 2012. I desperately needed this as before that time, I was an apathetic student. I had few friends. I was unhappy and didn’t have any purpose in my life.</p>

<p>Finding the self help community was a turning point in my life. If I hadn’t discovered the material, I would be much worse off today than I am.</p>

<p>I started reading everything I could get my hands on. I watched every fitness youtube community video that I could find. For a while, I started getting beginner gains both in the gym and in life.</p>

<p>But I quickly plateaued. I was better off than I was, but worse than I wanted to be.</p>

<p>The reason for this was that I became obsessed with optimizing my life. I was overwhelmed with self help advice. Instead of taking action to improve things in my own life, I spent all my team reading blogs and watching movies telling me how I should live my life.</p>

<p>During this time, I thought about trying every possible method under the sun to improve myself: wake up early, read a book a day, paleo diets, vegan diets, workout routines, choosing a purpose in life, vitamin d supplements.</p>

<p>But the problem was, I wasn’t confident that what I was reading was the end all be all method to improve myself. After reading a blog on the paleo diet, instead of implementing the paleo diet I would start reading about vegan diets and considering the pros and cons of each method. Meanwhile, I stayed in my current ways and didn’t take any effort to improve myself as I wanted to be sure I had the “right way” to do something before I started doing it.</p>

<p>Over time, I started figuring out what worked for me, and now I live my life in a fairly productive manner. But what is to be gained by sharing this information I have learned?</p>

<p>Nothing new has been learned. It is just the system I have built by cherry picking the techniques of hundreds of other online writers and self help gurus. You can easily find a more consistent approach to living your life.</p>

<p>But no single method worked for me. My advice to anyone is just to pick one system and stick with it. Don’t read any other methods. Just stick with it and try things out for yourself. Over time you will figure out what works for you and what doesn’t. But most off all don’t get caught up in picking the best method. There is no best method. I am more productive now than I have been and that is because I created the method which works best for me. </p>

<p>So here is a list of what I try to do. Pick the best and leave the rest. </p>

<p>My System:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eat paleo</li>
<li>Wake up early</li>
<li>Go to gym every single day</li>
<li>Don’t get stuck in a routine. Try to do something new every day</li>
<li>Travel as much as possible</li>
<li>Don’t get addicted to motivation. Develop discipline instead</li>
<li>Meditate</li>
<li>Listen to uplifting music</li>
<li>Avoid drugs and alcohol</li>
<li>Mythologize your life</li>
<li>Surround yourself with virtuous and hardworking people</li>
<li>Create an epic purpose for your life</li>
<li>Write down your goals. Review them daily.</li>
<li>Always be friendly, even when people are mean to you</li>
<li>Smile as much as you can</li>
<li>Love or trick yourself into loving the process</li>
<li>Read books, not articles.</li>
<li>Act as if you're the character in your own movie</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tabletop RPG Revival</strong></p>

<p>I am currently in Scotland. I am going back home in two days. I am going to be home for a week Then I am going to London before heading east towards the Ukraine.</p>

<p>I want to bring a tabletop rpg with me when I return to London. In addition to just being fun, I think playing tabletop rpgs have many positive benefits. </p>

<p>Tabletop rpgs differ from other forms of recreation like reading, movies, and videogames in that they require creative energy. The more effort an activity requires, the more you will benefit from participating. Actually creating the experience for yourself is more rewarding and aids in personal development more than being a passive consumer of someone else's creation.
To enjoy a tabletop rpg, you have to be able to put yourself in the position of your character. </p>

<p>Finally, I think rpgs are a good starting point for mythologizing your life. Creating a backstory for your character and envisioning different motivations and goals is complementary to creating your own life story. </p>

<p><strong>Eating Healthy on the Road</strong></p>

<p>I try to stick to a paleo diet, but most paleo foods need to be cooked. I am compiling a list of foods that are easy to eat while on the road. I use a liberal definition of paleo, so don’t write and tell me that so and so is not technically paleo. If it is on the list, it is paleo enough for me and you can decide if you want to eat it or not. That said, if you can think of anything else that might be good for this list, DO write and tell me about it.</p>

<p>Healthy foods that can be eaten without preparation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blackberries</li>
<li>Raspberries</li>
<li>Blueberries</li>
<li>Spinach</li>
<li>Nuts</li>
<li>Seeds</li>
<li>Precooked Sausage</li>
</ul>

<p>Healthy foods that can be eaten with little preparation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Chicken</li>
<li>Bacon</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Picture Rule</strong></p>

<p>As a general rule, you get to take 3 pictures while traveling. The first picture is of a significant cultural or historical landmark. The second is of a beautiful landscape or part of nature. And the third is of yourself in whatever context you wish.</p>

<p>By reducing the number of pictures you take you force yourself to be discerning and prevent yourself from fetishizing your travels. Too often I see obsession with cataloging every aspect of a trip for the purpose of future consumption. Meanwhile the moment passes by and the experience  actual experience is lost.</p>

<p><strong>Finding Hosts on CouchSurfing</strong></p>

<p>Finding hosts on CouchSuring.com is very difficult. Back in the day, the ethos of the site was followed by all members. There were very few people who disrespected their hosts and vice versa.</p>

<p>Then the the site started to grow. Now in 2016, there is an unsavory contingent that see the website as an opportunity to take advantage of the goodwill of others rather than as mutually supportive community. </p>

<p>Most people on the site are still very friendly, enthusiastic, and conscientious travelers. But hosts are less likely to host due the possibility of disrespectful guests.</p>

<p>There are many guides out there on how to be a true couchsurfer, what to put in your profile, how to behave, et cetera. </p>

<p>There is no point in repeating the known knowns of CouchSurfing. Instead, I have come up with a few additional techniques that are effective for finding a place to stay.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the website to network.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before starting to use the site for surfing, I took advantage of the hangouts feature to find people in the area who are willing to meet for a drink or coffee. If you have a good personality and are comfortable meeting strangers, it is easy to build rapport and lasting friendships.</p>

<p>Meeting beforehand without the expectation of a room gives potential hosts an opportunity to evaluate you and see you are a friendly and respectful person. If you get along well, they are much more likely to let you into their home than if they are forced to judge based on your message and profile alone.</p>

<p>In my experience, between 25-50 percent of the people I have met on hangouts are willing to let me stay a few nights after meeting. This number increases or decreases depending on the city and time of year.</p>

<p>To make this work, you probably have to book a hostel for 2-3 nights before finding someone who is willing to host you. Meet for coffee, go to CouchSurfing meetups, and look for people on the website with similar interests as you. </p>

<p>So far this has been my most effective approach for finding a place to stay. Most people on CouchSurfing want to host, they just want a confirmation of character before doing so.</p>

<ul>
<li>Travel to Rural Areas
You have a much better chance of someone reaching out to you if you are traveling in rural areas. If you post your itinerary on the website, then hosts in the region will be notified that you are looking for a room and reach out to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rural areas get fewer travelers than major cities and so usually have fewer bad experiences. Oftentimes it gets lonely out in the countryside and they like to have visitors to keep them company. It can also be practical to have an occasional traveler who can help out if you are in an isolated area There are many reasons why people in rural areas are more likely to contact you, but in my experience they are much more likely to do so than people in large cities.</p>

<p>One problem with finding people to host in rural areas is that the CouchSurfing search engine doesn’t always do a great job listing people from nearby towns. For example, when I searched for Cairnryan, a small town on the coast of Scotland, I did not see any hosts who had logged in over the past 30 days. But after posting my itinerary, I was contacted by hosts in the nearby towns of New Luce, Glenluce, and Glentrool. They received an email about my arrival in region, but I had no way of knowing about their presence on the site. My suggestion when looking for hosts in rural areas is to search for nearby towns as well as the exact region you are traveling as there are frequently active users in those areas that the search engine misses.</p>

<ul>
<li>Travel to Non-English Speaking Countries</li>
</ul>

<p>English is the language of international business and everyone can benefit from knowing it. Practicing english with a native or even a non-native but proficient speaker is one of the best ways to learn. </p>

<p>This is particularly true in poorer countries. The lack of jobs means that most young people need to leave to find work. Being an English speaker is extremely useful for finding jobs overseas so the people relish the opportunity to practice, particularly those around college-age. This is exacerbated in rural areas where there are fewer areas to practice English than in major cities.</p>

<p><strong>A Thought About Romania</strong></p>

<p>I enjoy everywhere I visit, but there was one thing about Bucharest that bothered me, the lack of effort to preserve the historic feel of the city.</p>

<p>There is a section of the city called the Bucharest Old Town. There you can find churches and government buildings with lots of history. The history and the old architecture are the primary draws for me as I love learning about ancient cultures and how they shape how we live today.</p>

<p>You can also find strip clubs, bars, and sex shops in Bucharest Old Town, often right down the street from the ancient churches. And this is ruining tourism in Bucharest.</p>

<p>I understand that people like nightlife and travel to cities for bars and clubs. But I think that the history and architecture of the city should not be sacrificed on the altar of modernity. There is a place for both culture and fun in a city. I really hope that they implement a new zoning plan for the city that helps preserve the ancient feel of Old Town. Otherwise I think in the long run it is going to cost them a lot of money as tourists stop traveling to Bucharest in favor of cities with better preserved churches, monuments and museums. </p>

<p><strong>Optimizing Your Morning Fix</strong></p>

<p>Morning coffee is a happy tradition in the United States. It is satisfying to start the day with a few cups of home brewed coffee.</p>

<p>But traveling with your own coffee grinds while traveling adds unnecessary weight and is quite bulky. Oftentimes there is nowhere to brew your own coffee and one ends of resorting to buying coffee at a cafe instead.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is very expensive. Coffees in Europe tend to be much smaller than similarly prices coffees in the United States and buying coffee from a cafe is almost always more expensive than brewing your own.</p>

<p>So deciding to forgo or not to forgo coffee is a decision all travelers need to make. But luckily, there are a few alternatives that can be substituted.</p>

<p>The ritual of drinking coffee in the morning can not be replicated, but if one views coffee as simply a delivery system for caffeine, stimulants in general, or energy even more generally, there are a few other methods to be considered.</p>

<ul>
<li>Caffeine Pills:</li>
<li>Tea</li>
<li>Coffee</li>
<li>Brew Your Own</li>
<li>Preworkout</li>
<li>Vitamin D</li>
</ul>

<p>Things to Consider:
- Cost
- Health
- Effectiveness - (Jolt, Tolerance, Duration…)
- Legality</p>

<p>Caffeine Alternatives Analysis</p>

<p>Caffeine Pills</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>The most cost effective option. You can buy 100 pills containing 200mg of caffeine each from amazon for $0.08/pill. A 12 fl oz americano coffee has ~150 mg so each pill gives a little bit more caffeine than an average coffee for a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p>Cost per Year:
Assuming you want 400 mg per day.</p>

<p>0.08 * 2 * 356 = $56.96</p>

<p>Cons:
Tolerance Develops Quickly. Because it is so easy to take pills, it is very easy to start upping your dose in the morning chasing the rush you get from the pills when you first start taking them.</p>

<p>Increasing dosage also makes it more difficult to sleep. </p>

<p>If you are going to take caffeine pills, I would take them first thing in the morning and never take more than 2 in a day. After 1.5 weeks you won’t get the same rush, but you will be alert and ready to start the day.</p>

<p>Health:</p>

<p>It is possible to hallucinate on large dosages.</p>

<p>Certainly better for your health than soda. Probably better for your health than pre workout. Worse for your health than coffee or tea.</p>

<p>Legal Status:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unscheduled in the United States.</li>
<li>Can’t be bought over the counter in Ireland</li>
<li>Prescription required in the Russian Federation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Working on the Road</strong></p>

<p>My plan when I graduated college was to live with my parents and start a business. I was going to grind out 12-14 hour days developing software products which I would give away for free. I figured I would learn enough doing this that I would either be skilled enough to start working as a consultant or have a good enough product that I could continue development and start a company with the premium business model. </p>

<p>This idea died quickly. I couldn’t work consistently for 3 hours at a time and certainly not the 10+ I had hoped to do. I felt like a prisoner in my own home and was extremely unproductive, spending most of my time watching videos online when I was supposed to be working. Being home all the time on my computer with little outside contact with friends was rotting my brain and crushing my dream.</p>

<p>I knew I had to make a change, I was fresh out of college with no job and very little work to show for it. So I got on a plane to Moldova, the poorest country in Europe. I figured that at least I could learn Russian and gain a little perspective on the world. I also hoped that a little danger would help me forget how unhappy I was.</p>

<p>Remarkably, being in Moldova cleared up all the brain fog I had accumulated since graduation. Moldova is an exciting country because it is very different from the United States. It was refreshing and fun, even though the country itself is poor and depressed.</p>

<p>I think I could have gone anywhere and achieved a similar effect. My problem had been the lack novelty and social interaction. I had a vision of being a superstar engineer who does nothing but write brilliant code. I either overestimated myself or misunderstood the archetype. While I am sure that some people can do nothing but write code, I personally don’t have the character to do so.</p>

<p>But this limitation is actually an advantage. Now I travel the world, and am more productive than I have ever been in my life. Constantly being on the move having adventures gives me tremendous energy and I now get done in 4 hours what would have taken me 12 hours back home. I get up at 5:00 in the morning and work for 7 hours without getting distracted, something I was never able to do at home. I then have the rest of the day to do whatever I want, be it meet new people, go to a museum, or just read a book or play an rpg.</p>

<p>I get to explore the world and have great life experiences while working. I get to learn both hard skills like managing servers and writing code while also learning about other people and their cultures. Eventually I will have to get a “real job” like everybody else, but right now I have the best of both worlds and am happier than I have ever been. Life is good. </p>

<p><strong>Practical Beliefs</strong></p>

<p>If your goal in life is to become a glorious hero king, then you to need cultivate practical beliefs. And to cultivate practical beliefs, you need to control the information you are exposed to.</p>

<p>Not all good information is good information, even if it is true. Oftentimes, beliefs founded on false information are more practical than beliefs founded on true information. In this situation, it is better to hold the false belief.</p>

<p>When I was kid, I wanted to be a professional athlete. I thought that I had the talent and dedication to do so. Because of this belief, I spent my early years playing sports, going to the gym and training.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I turned out not to be genetically gifted enough to compete at the top level of my sport. But what was lost by holding this false belief? Nothing. What was gained from the belief? I lived a healthier lifestyle, and made lots of friends over our love for a shared activity.</p>

<p>The power of belief works in reverse as well. If I believed that I didn’t have the intelligence to become an engineer, I would never have gone to the library, done the reading, and worked to become good at my trade. I would have settled for a less satisfying career and been less happy overall as a result.</p>

<p>The power of belief works even when the information is obviously false.</p>

<p>For example, suppose that you have a runic tattoo on your arm that you believe makes you a stronger individual. When you go to the gym, your belief in the power of the rune allows you to lift more weight and become healthier as a result.</p>

<p>Now obviously runes do not imbue you with the power of the gods as some pagan religions might claim. But by believing it to be true, you are able to improve the quality of your own life. I think the trade, retaining false information in exchange for practical beliefs and a higher quality of life, is a smart one to make.</p>

<p>This is why I advocate a complete boycott of news media. </p>

<p>News media almost always contributes to negative beliefs. Attacking and hating others is the standard formula for selling newspapers in America. Disaster and conspiracy dominate the news coverage. Following the news always leaves me feeling less happy and motivated than when I abstain.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you are not losing anything from abstaining. None of the information in the news is actionable. </p>

<p>Statistically, your vote is meaningless in elections. By following the news you have a huge opportunity cost in terms of time spent learning mostly useless information and the sacrifice to your mental health.</p>

<p>The belief that you as an individual are responsible for participating in the democracy is wrong. A far better use of your time if you intention is to contribute to the betterment of society is either to volunteer your time locally, or work more hours and donate the proceeds to charity. Giving well has already done the legwork for you and figured out the best way to make the most of your money.
<strong>A Thought on IT</strong></p>

<p>In the future, information security and perhaps IT in general will not be managed by tech companies, but by insurance firms.</p>

<p>The problem with information security in it’s current form is that there is one of incentives. </p>

<p>Companies seek to maximize profit. Data breach and other information security risks represent a threat to profit, but one cannot determine the risk without spending money. To the layperson, if the system is not currently compromised, then investing money to investigate current infosec infrastructure and analyze risks seems like an unnecessary expenditure.</p>

<p>The result is that many companies do not use best security practices and put the business at serious risk of financial lost in the event of an attack as well as the user's data.</p>

<p>A new system which incentivizes security needs to be put in place. I think one practical solution to this would be to have mandatory cybersecurity insurance.</p>

<p>The insurance company is responsible for insuring the company in the case of a data loss. To calculate the premium, the insurance company needs to be able to audit a company's security plan and servers. If the company does not comply with best practices and have a strong security posture, then they are charged a higher premium. To keep this premiums down, the companies then start investing in cybersecurity solutions.</p>

<p>It may go further than this and the company completely outsources their cybersecurity. The cybersecurity provider is then liable for ensuring the company is not compromised. It’s sole incentive at this point is to prevent losses and bring down the cost of security. </p>
